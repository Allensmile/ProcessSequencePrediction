  "body": "Following is the supplementary material for the article [\"Predictive Business Process Monitoring with\r\nLSTM Neural Networks\"](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rt2a48ralqspf28/paper.pdf?dl=0) by Niek Tax, Ilya Verenich, [Marcello La Rosa](http://www.marcellolarosa.com/) and [Marlon Dumas](http://kodu.ut.ee/~dumas/).\r\n\r\nThe code provided in this repository can be readily used to perform the following predictive tasks:\r\n* Prediction of the next type of activity to be executed in a running process instance\r\n* Prediction of the timestamp of the next type of activity to be executed\r\n* Prediction of the continuation of a running instance, i.e. its suffix\r\n* Prediction of the remaining cycle time of an instance\r\n\r\nThe scripts trains an [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)- or [RNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)-based predictive model using the data about historical, i.e. completed process instances. Next, the models are evaluated on running, i.e. incomplete instances.\r\n\r\n**Requirements:**   \r\nPython 2. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required to run the code: [_keras_](https://keras.io/) (as a backend, you need either _theano_ or _tensorflow_), _unicodecsv_, _numpy_, _jellyfish_, _sklearn_, _matplotlib_, _h5py_.  \r\nNote you might need the latest version of _keras_ to run the code. Install it as:    \r\n`pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git`\r\n\r\n**USAGE:**  \r\n**Model training:**   \r\n`python train.py`    \r\nThis script trains a two-layer LSTM model with one shared layer on one of the data files in the data folder of this repository (by default, on the [_helpdesk_ event log](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/39bp3vv62t/1)). To change the input file to another one from the data folder, indicate its name in line 46. It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent networks are quite computationally intensive. \r\n\r\n**Evaluation:**  \r\n`python evaluate_next_activity_and_time.py`   \r\nThis script takes as input the LSTM or RNN weights found by `train.py` and predicts the next event and its relative timestep for a partial trace. Change the path in line 176 of this script to point to the h5 file with LSTM or RNN weights generated by train.py. As an example, we provide the file _model_89-1.50.h5_ with one of the trained models\r\n\r\n`python evaluate_suffix_and_remaining_time.py`   \r\nThis script predicts the continuation of a partial trace, i.e. its suffix, until its completion.\r\n\r\n`python calculate_accuracy_on_next_event.py`.\r\nThis script evaluates the performance of the next event prediction (not the whole suffix). It takes the output of `evaluate_suffix_and_remaining_time.py` as input, therefore, the latter needs to be executed first\r\n\r\n**Known issues:**\r\n* On some systems, the scripts cause an error _UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xa7' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)_. As a temporary solution, you can include the following lines in the beginning of a script:  \r\n`import sys`   \r\n`reload(sys)`   \r\n`sys.setdefaultencoding(\"utf-8\")`   \r\n* [issue](https://github.com/jamesturk/jellyfish/issues/55) in the _jellyfish_ package that calculates Damerau-Levenshtein distance may appear in logs with a very high number of activity types\r\n",
