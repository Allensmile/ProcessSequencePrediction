The input file can be changed to another file from the data folder in by changing the path in both line 47 and 124. It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent networks are quite computationally intensive.\r\n\r\n**Evaluation:**\r\n`python evaluation.py` \r\nThis script takes as input the LSTM or RNN weights found by `train.py`. Change the path in line 172 of this script to point to the h5 file with LSTM or RNN weights generated by train.py\r\n\r\n**Parameters:**   \r\n* _to-be-filled_ - \r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this code is a supplementary material and should be modified for the use with other datasets\r\n",
