The input file can be changed to another file from the data folder in by changing the path in both line 47 and 124. It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent networks are quite computationally intensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Output:**\r\n* h5 models\r\n* files\r\n\r\n**Parameters:**   \r\n* _to-be-filled_ - \r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\n\r\n\r\nNote that this code is a supplementary material and should be modified for the use with other datasets\r\n",
